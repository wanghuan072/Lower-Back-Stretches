        <h2>10 Lower Back Pain Stretches</h2>
<p>This video presents ten <a href="/">Lower Back Stretches</a> for lower back pain and emphasizes that not all back pain is the same, so stretches should be tailored to the specific condition to be effective. The host, physical therapist Dr. Jared, categorizes the stretches based on the four types of lower back pain he most often treats in his clinic.</p>

<h2>Stretches from the Video</h2>
<h3>1. Lumbar Rotation Stretch</h3>
<p>Lying on your back, gently drop both knees to one side to stretch the hips and lower back. This is considered safe for most conditions. The single knee rotation is a more advanced option often included in <a href="/">Lower Back Stretches</a> routines.</p>

<h3>2. Single Knee to Chest Stretch</h3>
<p>Lying on your back, pull one knee toward your chest to stretch the glutes and lower back. Approach this with caution if you have a herniated disc.</p>

<h3>3. Double Knee to Chest Stretch</h3>
<p>Pulling both knees to the chest at the same time introduces more flexion in the back. This stretch is often beneficial for conditions like arthritis and degenerative disc disease but should be done with caution if you have a bulging disc.</p>

<h3>4. Piriformis Stretch</h3>
<p>This stretch targets the deep hip rotators by crossing one leg over the other and pulling the legs toward the chest. It's generally liked by most people and is great for relieving tightness in the glute area.</p>

<h3>5. Hamstring Stretch</h3>
<p>Using a belt or towel, you pull your straight leg up while lying on your back to stretch the hamstring. This stretch is considered safe for most types of lower back pain but should be done with caution if you have a bulging disc or sciatica. Many people add it to their daily <strong>Lower Back Stretches</strong> practice for better flexibility.</p>

<h3>6. Prone Progression (Cobra)</h3>
<p>Lying on your stomach and propping yourself up on your elbows or hands, this stretch introduces extension into the back. It is especially recommended for herniated or bulging discs but should be avoided with conditions like arthritis and stenosis.</p>

<h3>7. Child's Pose</h3>
<p>This stretch involves kneeling and rounding your back while sitting toward your heels to introduce flexion throughout the entire spine. It is great for three of the four pain conditions but should be avoided with a herniated disc.</p>

<h3>8. Cat-Cow Stretch</h3>
<p>This dynamic stretch involves alternating between rounding and arching the back on all fours. It is excellent for introducing general motion into the back, but extreme flexion or extension can aggravate certain conditions.</p>

<h3>9. Hip Flexor Stretch</h3>
<p>This stretch involves kneeling and lunging forward to stretch the front of the hip. It is helpful for addressing tight hip flexors that may contribute to lower back pain.</p>

        <h2>Stretches for Lower Back Pain Relief</h2>
<p>This video, led by fitness instructor Heather Robertson, provides a series of exercises and <a href="/">Lower Back Stretches</a> designed to help relieve lower back pain. She emphasizes that consistent practice can help increase flexibility, mobility, and range of motion. This routine only requires a mat or soft surface.</p>

<h2>Exercises and Stretches in the Video</h2>
<p>The routine includes the following movements, which are popular <a href="/">Lower Back Stretches</a> for improving mobility and reducing discomfort:</p>

<h3>1. Knee Lifts</h3>
<p>Lying on your back, gently pull one knee at a time toward your chest, keeping your lower back pressed into the mat. The host suggests aiming for about 10 repetitions per side.</p>

<h3>2. Knee Drops</h3>
<p>Lying on your back with both knees hugged to your chest, slowly drop your knees to one side in a controlled motion while keeping your shoulder blades on the mat. This stretches the lower back.</p>

<h3>3. Bridges</h3>
<p>With your feet planted and knees bent, lift your hips toward the ceiling by squeezing your glutes, then slowly lower them back down one vertebra at a time.</p>

<h3>4. Lower Body Twist</h3>
<p>Lying on your back, pull one knee into your chest and then gently guide it across your body, feeling a stretch in your back while looking in the opposite direction.</p>

<h3>5. Seated Twist</h3>
<p>While sitting with one leg crossed over the other, twist your upper body to one side, sitting up as tall as possible without any pain.</p>

<h3>6. Seated Cat-Cow</h3>
<p>From a cross-legged position, exhale to round your spine and inhale to open your chest and arch your back.</p>

<h3>7. Side Body Stretch</h3>
<p>From a cross-legged position, drop one elbow to the side and reach the opposite arm up and over to feel a stretch along the side of your body.</p>

<h3>8. Cat-Cow</h3>
<p>On all fours, alternate between rounding and arching your spine.</p>

<h3>9. Cobra</h3>
<p>Lying on your stomach, press through your palms to gently lift your chest while engaging your glutes and lower back.</p>

<h3>10. Child's Pose</h3>
<p>The video concludes with a child's pose, where you open your knees wide and let your belly relax while breathing deeply. This final position is one of the most relaxing <strong>Lower Back Stretches</strong> for easing tension and improving flexibility.</p>

<p>The host also notes that if you are experiencing consistent and excruciating pain, you should consult a doctor for professional advice.</p>

            <h2>7 Daily Stretches for Lower Back Pain</h2>
<p>This video introduces seven daily <a href="/">Lower Back Stretches</a> that can help alleviate lower back pain. The instructor suggests holding each stretch for 40 to 60 seconds, or longer if a particular spot feels tight. These stretches are designed to increase your range of motion and relax tight muscles, making them ideal for a quick daily routine.</p>

<h2>The Seven Stretches in the Video</h2>
<h3>1. Elevated Cat-Cow</h3>
<p>Performed with your hands on an elevated surface like a bench or chair, this stretch involves alternating between arching your back (cow) and rounding your spine (cat) to increase spinal range of motion. Itâ€™s one of the most accessible <strong>Lower Back Stretches</strong> for improving mobility.</p>

<h3>2. Lateral Line Hip Drop</h3>
<p>Starting on a forearm with one leg extended and the other crossed over, you sink into the hip and then reach up for a side body stretch. This is particularly great for sciatica and IT band pain.</p>

<h3>3. Seated Figure Four</h3>
<p>This targets the outer glute and piriformis muscles. The instructor demonstrates a seated version where you cross one ankle over the opposite knee. A more advanced version is shown on the floor where you pull the crossed leg toward your chest, then drop your legs to the side and rotate your spine.</p>

<h3>4. Bird-Dog</h3>
<p>This is a core-strengthening exercise performed on all fours. You extend an opposite arm and leg simultaneously while keeping your hips and shoulders square to the mat.</p>

<h3>5. Thread the Needle</h3>
<p>From a kneeling position, with one leg extended to the side, you reach one arm up and then thread it under the other arm, bringing your shoulder and ear toward the mat for a spinal rotation and inner thigh stretch.</p>

<h3>6. Child's Pose</h3>
<p>With your big toes touching and knees wide, you push your hips back and extend your arms forward. The video also shows a variation where you walk your hands to one side to deepen the stretch in the upper back, lower back, and lats.</p>

<h3>7. Side Pretzel</h3>
<p>Lying on your back, you bring your knees to your chest, then rotate your lower body to one side, keeping your shoulders on the mat for a mid-spine and low-back rotation. This finishing position is one of the simplest <strong>Lower Back Stretches</strong> for daily recovery and flexibility.</p>
